# BioDietix Legal Site

This directory is a static, responsive HTML/CSS site for the BioDietix privacy policy, external account-deletion instructions, and support contact. It has no JavaScript, analytics, advertising, tracking code, cookies, or third-party visual assets.

## Required replacements

Before publishing, replace every occurrence of:

- `meliheren2834@gmail.com` with the monitored public support/privacy email address.
- `2026-07-01` with the legally approved effective date, using an unambiguous format such as `1 July 2026`.

Check that no unresolved placeholder remains:

```bash
rg -n 'meliheren2834@gmail.com|2026-07-01' legal-site
```

Do not replace the documented public URLs unless the hosting option changes. Obtain final legal review and reconcile the pages with the production backend/Firebase configuration, retention schedule, Play Data Safety form, and Health Apps declaration.

## Option A — separate `biodietix-legal` repository

This option produces the URLs already embedded in the pages and is the simplest separation from application source.

1. Create a public GitHub repository owned by `meliherenn` and name it exactly `biodietix-legal`.
2. Copy the contents of this `legal-site/` directory—not the directory wrapper—to the new repository root.
3. Commit and push the files to its `main` branch.
4. Open **Settings → Pages** in that repository.
5. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, select `main`, choose `/ (root)`, and save.
6. Wait for the Pages deployment, then test every page on mobile and desktop without signing in.

Expected URLs:

- Home: `https://meliherenn.github.io/biodietix-legal/`
- Privacy: `https://meliherenn.github.io/biodietix-legal/privacy-policy.html`
- Account deletion: `https://meliherenn.github.io/biodietix-legal/delete-account.html`

## Option B — publish from the BioDietix repository

GitHub Pages branch settings publish only a branch root or `/docs`, not an arbitrary directory as the site root. Use one of these approaches:

- Create a `gh-pages` branch whose root contains the contents of `legal-site/`; or
- Configure an official GitHub Pages Actions workflow that uploads `legal-site/` as the Pages artifact.

When `legal-site/` is published as the Pages artifact root for the `BioDietix` project repository, expected URLs are:

- Home: `https://meliherenn.github.io/BioDietix/`
- Privacy: `https://meliherenn.github.io/BioDietix/privacy-policy.html`
- Account deletion: `https://meliherenn.github.io/BioDietix/delete-account.html`

If this option is selected, update both HTML canonical/absolute links and the Flutter build defines to the `BioDietix` URLs before publishing. Do not enable Pages from the application repository root without reviewing what other repository content would become part of the generated site.

## Pre-publication verification

From the repository root:

```bash
rg -n 'meliheren2834@gmail.com|2026-07-01' legal-site
rg -n '<script|analytics|googletag|cookie' legal-site --glob '*.html'
python -m http.server 8080 --directory legal-site
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` and verify:

- all navigation, privacy, deletion, and `mailto:` links;
- English and Turkish deletion instructions;
- mobile layout, keyboard focus, zoom, and text scaling;
- the medical-device disclaimer and legal-review notice;
- no network requests other than the local page assets; and
- the public Pages URLs after deployment.

## Final Flutter production build

After Option A is live, placeholders are replaced, counsel has approved the pages, the production API host is confirmed, and release signing is configured, run from `mobile/`:

```bash
flutter build appbundle --release --flavor prod \
  --dart-define=FLAVOR=prod \
  --dart-define=BIODIETIX_API_URL=https://YOUR_PRODUCTION_API_HOST \
  --dart-define=BIODIETIX_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL=https://meliherenn.github.io/biodietix-legal/privacy-policy.html \
  --dart-define=BIODIETIX_ACCOUNT_DELETION_URL=https://meliherenn.github.io/biodietix-legal/delete-account.html \
  --dart-define=BIODIETIX_SUPPORT_EMAIL=meliheren2834@gmail.com \
  --dart-define=BIODIETIX_APP_CHECK_ENABLED=true
```

Replace `YOUR_PRODUCTION_API_HOST` and `SUPPORT_EMAIL`, increment `--build-number` for every Play upload, and never upload an AAB built with placeholders.
